How to install ZED Camera Wrapper for ROS
1. Download ZED SDK for TX1 (or TX2)
2. Find downloaded .run file in Downloads folder and (if needed) make it executable using `chmod +x`
3. Run it using `./ZED_SDK_LINUX_JTX1_JP...`
4. Accept all installation options
5. Follow other instruction for downloading and installing ZED ROS wrapper.
6. Execute `catkin_make zed-ros-wrapper` in your catkin directory
7. `source ./devel/setup.bash`



Mandatory:
1. Add to `.bashrc` the following: `export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages`
in order to run the car_inputs.py node (probably it's needed for all nodes)
2. In order to run nodes: make nodes (.py files which are nodes) executeable using `chmod +x <file_name>.py`and by adding this at the top of the .py file: `#!/usr/bin/env python`



Helpful Tips:
1. *source devel/setup.bash*
2. ROS's built-in `sensor_msgs` package defines messages for commonly used sensors. The ZED camera uses `Image.msg` message type when publishing images. Its implementation can be found using `roscd sensor_msgs/msg`



TODO:
1. Write file for user options and read from it in different files that use user options
2. Write launch file
3. Get everything to compile
4. Maybe update ZED firmware, but need help to do so.
    
Progeress: Tried this: roslaunch zed_wrapper display.launch
But it says yaml doesn't have attribute add_representer. Actually, does that make sense or should it be "function" instead of attribute? O.o gotta look into that.
