How to install ZED Camera Wrapper for ROS
1. Download ZED SDK for TX1 (or TX2)
2. Find the downloaded .run file in Downloads folder and make it executable using `chmod +x`
3. Run it using `./ZED_SDK_LINUX_JTX1_JP...`
4. Accept all installation options
5. Follow other instruction for downloading and installing ZED ROS wrapper.
6. Execute `catkin_make zed-ros-wrapper` in your catkin directory
7. `source ./devel/setup.bash`
8. The wrapper ends up being a git repo so you can do `git pull` to update it.



Mandatory:
1. Add to `.bashrc` the following: `export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages` in order to run the ROS nodes
2. Nodes must be executable to work: make nodes executable using `chmod +x <file_name>.py` and by adding this at the top of the .py file: `#!/usr/bin/env python`



Helpful Tips / Troubleshooting:
1. source devel/setup.bash
2. ROS's built-in `sensor_msgs` package defines messages for commonly used sensors. The ZED camera uses `Image.msg` message type when publishing images. Its implementation can be found using `roscd sensor_msgs/msg`
3. Settings for the ZED camera are found at zed.launch, and the launch file(s) it includes. Also be sure to read its READMEs which are at multiple places in its directory tree.
4. When connecting the flash drive used for storing log files, it mounts itself at /media/nvidia/rosbags
5. Make sure correct path to Arduino is set in params file




TODO:

1. Maybe update ZED firmware, but need help to do so.
2. Make sure the return data queue in new_driver doesn't become filled with old data. Maybe just create a new queue every time a NN is invoked
3. Change nn directory name to "backend" and make sure everything still runs
4. Consider changing constants in Arduino code from "#define" to final ints.
5. test car around. (Can use blue battery for computer)
6. try out the screen program by sshing in, running program, disconnecting, reconnecting, and getting back to screen.
7. Add human accelerates mode and human steers mode
8. Add rosbags


99. Ask Sascha if code structure and naming conventions are intuitive for him

97. Put correct file description comments at the beginning of each file
98. Note: i've changed the permissions of /media/nvidia/rosbags to allow writing to it (for log files)
99. Remove BDDDualImage message type if not needed
