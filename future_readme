How to install ZED Camera Wrapper for ROS
1. Download ZED SDK for TX1 (or TX2)
2. Find downloaded .run file in Downloads folder and (if needed) make it executable using `chmod +x`
3. Run it using `./ZED_SDK_LINUX_JTX1_JP...`
4. Accept all installation options
5. Follow other instruction for downloading and installing ZED ROS wrapper.
6. Execute `catkin_make zed-ros-wrapper` in your catkin directory
7. `source ./devel/setup.bash`




Helpful Tips:
1. ROS's built-in `sensor_msgs` package defines messages for commonly used sensors. The ZED camera uses `Image.msg` message type when publishing images. Its implementation can be found using `roscd sensor_msgs/msg`
